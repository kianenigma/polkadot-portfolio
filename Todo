So on react app: (first version)
  [x] Load the networks from a list on startup
  [x] Store accounts in local storage (or indexed db)
  [x] Flat structure of the items
  [x] Show summary of the assets
  [x] update UI for better account management
  [x] Remove the redundant stuff
  [x] Network input validation
  [x] Account input validation
  [x] update app name

Core: 
  [] fix fetch coin values (background fetch?)

Networks and Accounts: 
  [] Auto complete for networks: We should have a list of hardcoded networks (copy pasta from polkadot.js/apps), and upon adding a new network, you should be able to just type “Polkadot” and it should potentially suggest a known ws endpoint for it.
  [] Networks should have icons (hardcoded)
  [] Accounts should have icon as well (https://github.com/polkadot-js/ui/tree/master/packages/react-identicon#readme). 

Actions on Token Table:
  [x] Sortable Table
  [x] Filtering by Accounts 
  [x] Filtering by Networks
  [] Filtering small amounts
  [] Filtering by Token Name
  [] Filtering table by values 
  [] Grouping stuff by headliners (harder)
  [] Hovering on any token amount should show its decimal points, and the actual underlying value

Feedback from Kian:
  Bugs: 
    [x] Changing networks (adding/removing) should also re-trigger a scrape
    [x] Progress bar is not accurate
  
  Features: 
    [x] Table should be sort-able 
    [x] Accounts and networks should have an option to be saved in local storage
    [] Native assets and derivatives should be distinguished (task for Kian)
    [] Github deployment soon so we can shill it a bit and also request tips
